# WordGuess-cli

This is an interactive word guess game using inquirer as the interface. If you want to play, the computer randomly generates a word, and prompts the user to guess a letter. That letter is passed through two different constructors and see if the letter is a correct guess or not.

To use the program, run an npm init and install inquirer using the npm install inquirer command.
